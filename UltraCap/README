----------

Here are some experimental source files for running a brushbot using an
ultracapacitor. The new thing about the ultracapacitor is that the voltage is
always changing linearly whereas a battery has a slowly decreasing voltage over
time. To keep the motor running at constant speed this code measures the voltage
on the ultracapacitor and adjusts the PWM duty cycle to compensate.

The compensation is done in the motorVoltage.c file with this line:
    PWM = (Vm * ADCW) >> 8;
Here (ADCW) is the value of the internal reference (1.1 volts) as read by the
ADC using the ultracapacitor voltage as a reference, therefore the (ADCW) value
goes _up_ as the ultracapacitor voltage drops, so multiplying by (ADCW)
stretches the PWM compensating for the loss of voltage.

To compile this, change the motorVoltage/ directory and type
  make
This assumes a unix-like tool setup. Tested on Debian w/gcc 4.4.2-9
