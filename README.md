PARTS BrushBot Project Code
---------------------------

This repository contains the code for doing IR communications for the boards designed for Portland Area Robotics ([PARTS][s_parts]) Swarm project.

[s_parts]: http://portlandrobotics.org

For more information about this project, see the project web site: <http://colab.portlandrobotics.org/>

The current code base consists of Arduino sketches using an adapted core for the ATTiny44 MCU.  

The necessary hardware core files are in the partsSwarmHardware project.  Check that out into your Arduino hardware subdirectory.
